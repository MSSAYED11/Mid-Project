The online cinema ticket booking has developed what may be considered a simple project. The application lets users choose seats on a theater grid, views total pricing based on an individual seat selection, and finally takes the client's personal details for confirmation of the booking. All information regarding the movie, including the name and the price, appears on top. Users could confirm their bookings, provide their names, numbers, and emails, and afterward complete the payment upon filling out the form. It also has a modern, stylishly designed interface featuring an interactive seat selection and responsive layout.
